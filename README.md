# Camplified (Deprecated)

Camplified, an osu! leaderboard camping program but a simple implementation in Golang.

Currently the fastest osu! API v2 endless loop request in Synchronisation with native library implementation I've tried so far other than C.

This source has been **deprecated**. The replacement I'm using is a Python implementation of an integrated program and intend to rewrite and GUI'd these things in Kotlin or C#.
